Goal: Detect anomalous credit card transactions with an autoencoder trained on legitimate data, compare against ML baselines, and deploy a usable system.

Deliverables:

EDA and feature engineering notebook

Baseline ML models (LogReg, RandomForest, XGBoost)

Deep autoencoder with thresholding

FastAPI inference service

Streamlit monitoring dashboard

Interview‑ready documentation and demo
